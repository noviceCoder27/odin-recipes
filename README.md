# odin-recipes
A website on recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project which is a website about recipes. 

## HTML

**Tag used to create the links for the homepage**

 ```sh
 <a href = " "> Webpage </a>
 ```
`href` attribute is for linking the webpages together

**Tag used to link the images**

 ```sh
 <img src = " " alt = "Alternative text"> 
 ```

**Tag used to create the lists** 

Ordered Lists

```sh
 <ol>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
 </ol>
 ```
Unordered Lists

```sh
 <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
 </ul>
 ```
> Note: `<li>` is for list items
