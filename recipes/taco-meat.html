        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of course. Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add to bean burritos for a more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for Frito® Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco salad.
