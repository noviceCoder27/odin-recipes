        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            
            <li>Pour egg whites, eggs, and cottage cheese into a blender; pulse several times to mix and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus and onion until asparagus is tender, about 8 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Season shrimp with salt and black pepper; cook in hot oil until they turn pink and are no longer translucent in the center, 5 to 8 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate and spread shrimp into the crust; top with asparagus mixture. Pour cottage cheese mixture over vegetables and shrimp. Spread Monterey Jack cheese over the top of the quiche. Sprinkle green onions over cheese.
            </li>

            <li>Bake quiche in the preheated oven until cheese topping is lightly browned and the quiche is set in the center, about 1 hour.
